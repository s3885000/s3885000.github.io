          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>In this 4.0 World, thanks to the rapid earth-shattering increment of convenience, operation, and reliance on the Internet. We can now purchase goods online, pay bills, and do all sorts of things virtually without the need for physical activities. And because of that, the Internet can act like "a double-edged sword." It can be a benefit for you at the same time it can be bad for you. With such a vast population worldwide, who has access to the Internet can be a vulnerable place for innocent people to get attack anonymously, just like a real-life crime. The Internet called them hackers who go after people's sensitive information without the victim's consent. Thanks to the technologies we are currently having right now Cybersecurity is here to protect people's privacy from getting exposed.</p>
           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/Cybersecurity content img.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
           <p>Cybersecurity is the process of protecting networks, computer data, sensitive information against malicious entry or illegal use, and the process of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and access to information. Cybersecurity requires methods to protect data and operational infrastructure from unwanted digital access to separate networks' digital elements. Depending on the type of network you are connected to and the kind of cyber threats to which you are vulnerable, there are various ways to integrate Cybersecurity.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Malware attacks</li></div> 
           <p>Malware attacks such as trojans, adware, spyware, to name a few, are some of the most common examples of cyber-attacks. Your operating system may have been compromised by such malware viruses embedded inside the attachments once the victim has opened the unusual attachments online.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Phishing attacks</li></div> 
           <p>The sort of cyber-attack where an experienced hacker tries to deliver fake emails that seem to come from a reputable source is another common cyber-attack called a phishing attack. This is done to install Malware or steal data such as credit card information and login credentials sensitive.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)</li></div> 
           <p>From here, the hacker gets access to the data path between the computer of the victim and the server of the website. By doing so, the hacker's device takes over an IP address, remotely intercepting the contact line between the victim and the website. With unsecured internet networks and even by Malware, this typically exists.</p>
           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/pandasecurity-types-malware.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
           <p>To deter potential cyber threats and enforce a few cyber protection practices, citizens should also create a firewall. The name implies a virtual shield between a user's machine and the Internet. Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing data from the user interface to secure the network and can be used either for software applications or hardware reinforcements.</p>
           <p>Cyber-attacks are not just confined to individuals but also to public and private organizations. They are more deadly in those areas, and the companies end in tremendous casualties. There are several explanations for such attacks, beginning with tampering with crucial data to monetary gains results. There are few types of cyber-attacks that companies are subjected to various public sector organizations, and large corporations face the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). In this type of assault, hackers have been given access to classified details over an extended period. Companies have also experienced a Denial of Service (DoS) assault where the networks are overwhelmed with traffic, leaving valid service demands. A variation of this is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where several networks are used to initiate an attack, and the list goes on.</p>

          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>Cyber-attacks can lead to electrical blackouts, malfunction of military equipment, and breach of national security secrets. They will allow important, confidential data to be stolen, such as medical records. It will interrupt or paralyze the phone and computer systems and make data inaccessible. It is no exaggeration to suggest that cyber-attacks will affect the operations of existence as we know it. Not just individuals and businesses are the only victims of cyber-attacks, but it can also scale up to a country's nation. Take a look at the greatest country in the world, like the U.S.A. In the real-world United States is typically an ally with Canada, UK, and Germany, but there are no allies in cyberspace. Do you realize over 10% of cyber-attacks are coming from Canada, 17% are coming from the UK? These are countries that we think are allies, but itâ€™s every country for themselves in cyberspace.</p>
           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/cybersecurity22.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
           <p>From this significant impact that Cybersecurity has been contributed to the world. With more and more people and businesses moving online daily, it is becoming increasingly important for people and companies to ensure that no one tries to steal their data or money. That's why Cybersecurity plays a vital role in companies and individuals. It involves protecting computer-aided equipment and information from unintentional or unauthorized access, which alters more destruction. And to ensure that peoples and big organizations confidential information are in a safe hand. From the extensive cooperation's point of view, you want to make sure that your employees will have a safe working environment. If an employee's system is corrupted, it will potentially impair their workplace efficiency and even cause you to replace a new system. And from individuals like our self-point of view, we want to experience a safe and worry-free when purchasing goods or pay bills without worrying that someone is watching us and potentially steal our sensitive personal information.</p>

          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>Cybersecurity is becoming an essential part of our daily life, and the explanation of this kind of mindset is little more than an improvement in technical dependency. It is also a crucial part of our lives, and all data containing sensitive personal data, medical records, protection information, financial information are stored on the Internet, and so on.  It's a place where data will exist forever, but it's not that secure unless it's encrypted with any Cybersecurity applications. Therefore, it plays a vital role in our project proposal. We want to make sure that usersâ€™ sensitive information like personal identity and credit card information are being kept safe from outsiders. By introducing Cryptographic hash function embed into our application and Cybersecurity, we can make the application safe for the users.</p>
