          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>In this 4.0 World, thanks to the rapid earth-shattering increment of convenience, operation, and reliance on the Internet. We can now purchase goods online, pay bills, and do all sorts of things virtually without the need for physical activities. And because of that, the Internet can act like "a double-edged sword." It can be a benefit for you at the same time it can be bad for you. With such a vast population worldwide, who has access to the Internet can be a vulnerable place for innocent people to get attack anonymously, just like a real-life crime. The Internet called them hackers who go after people's sensitive information without the victim's consent. Thanks to the technologies we are currently having right now Cybersecurity is here to protect people's privacy from getting exposed.</p>
           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/Cybersecurity content img.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
           <p>Cybersecurity is the process of protecting networks, computer data, sensitive information against malicious entry or illegal use, and the process of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and access to information. Cybersecurity requires methods to protect data and operational infrastructure from unwanted digital access to separate networks' digital elements. Depending on the type of network you are connected to and the kind of cyber threats to which you are vulnerable, there are various ways to integrate Cybersecurity.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Malware attacks</li></div> 
           <p>Malware attacks such as trojans, adware, spyware, to name a few, are some of the most common examples of cyber-attacks. Your operating system may have been compromised by such malware viruses embedded inside the attachments once the victim has opened the unusual attachments online.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Phishing attacks</li></div> 
           <p>The sort of cyber-attack where an experienced hacker tries to deliver fake emails that seem to come from a reputable source is another common cyber-attack called a phishing attack. This is done to install Malware or steal data such as credit card information and login credentials sensitive.</p>
           <div class="bullets"><li>Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)</li></div> 
           <p>From here, the hacker gets access to the data path between the computer of the victim and the server of the website. By doing so, the hacker's device takes over an IP address, remotely intercepting the contact line between the victim and the website. With unsecured internet networks and even by Malware, this typically exists.</p>
           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/pandasecurity-types-malware.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
           <p>To deter potential cyber threats and enforce a few cyber protection practices, citizens should also create a firewall. The name implies a virtual shield between a user's machine and the Internet. Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing data from the user interface to secure the network and can be used either for software applications or hardware reinforcements.</p>

          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been debated and explored for a long time. However, they are just now come to light as financial tools that can be open and valuable not only to hard-earned appreciators.

           <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/exchanges.png">*self screenshot</div>
           <p>From this possible effect that Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies have had, and has become a beneficial improvement in economic activities across the world. The rate at which the cryptocurrency market is growing is humongous since early adopters, who have become wealthy instantly and have sought ways to expand financially, can invoke. For comparison, over one third of the world's countries do not have access to essential financing services that will help them in the event of a personal financial crisis â€“ mortgages, audit services, etc. With the outstanding development of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, now many applications and exchanges allow users to buy, sell and use cryptocurrencies globally without approval from authorities or government control so that trading can be done freely with Blockchain decentralization technology.</p>
           <p>In the last recent years, Big companies worldwide are starting to adopt Blockchain Technology into their operations. Please take a look at companies like Walmart and nine other grocery companies that have teamed up with IBM to develop a Blockchain to track records across their supply chains. And this year, companies like MicroStrategy put 90% of their capital on this bold allocation to buy Cryptocurrency (BTC). Companies like Paypal already allow users to buy, hold, and sell Cryptocurrency. Sooner or later, Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrency will significantly impact people's lives around the globe.</p>

          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>As of today, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies have no practical impact on our lives. But the truth is, Blockchain has an effect on our daily lives. It is just that technology is in its early stages and is prone to transition and growth. For example, the healthcare networks and the number of data required to be searched and retrieved everyday. It requires a lot of time. With Blockchain's support, we will build a global timestamp record database and a library that enables fast data extraction through various databases. And with the pace of monetary inflation we are currently in right now; Cryptocurrency will be in the lead as an alternative method of inflation protection due to the restriction of total circulation supply on Cryptocurrency. It just like Gold but in digital form.</p>
           <p>Cryptocurrency will become the default currency worldwide for many people, eliminating exchange-rate fees and other costs associated with exchanging money. But this is just the beginning of its journey; in order to gain people's interest, Cryptocurrency needs to be easy for everyone to participate. By educating people on how digitized currency can counterparts and benefit in daily life. As soon as people from around the world realize the potential advantages of Cryptocurrency and are thrill to use it in everyday life. That is when new businesses are going to bloom in the field. With these technologies already in place, we can see that they can have an impact on the project ideas that have been mentioned above. Instead of paying extortionate transaction fees to the government and banks, we can give users the option to use digitized currency as an alternative payment method. Even the smallest companies can save money and acquire faster transactions, thanks to Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.</p>
