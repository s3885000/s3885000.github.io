          <div class="extra_wrapper">
           <p>Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions within a peer-to-peer network that can be shared openly by different users to create a fixed record of transactions, each with a timestamp and linked to the previous. Each time a series of transactions is added, this data becomes another block in the chain. This technology enables participants to confirm transactions without the need for a central clearing authority. Possible applications can be money transfer, transaction processing, voting, and many other topics. What it means is when a participant transfers money to a receiver, the transaction won't go through government, authority, or banking systems for clearance. Sometimes transferring money from bank to bank could fail due to technical issues, account hacking, daily transfer exceeding the limits, or high transfer fees. How does Blockchain remain relatively hack-proof? The answer is that the millions of blockchain users can make it difficult for anyone to destroy or corrupt the network.</p>
           <p>The concept of Cryptocurrency was born. It is a type of digital currency focused on blockchain-referred technology. And cryptocurrencies are resistant to counterfeiting due to Blockchain, it does not require banking networks, and are secured by robust and sophisticated encrypted algorithms, making it impossible for individuals to hack or steal. How does Cryptocurrency work? Transactions between peer-to-peer are being sent using a technology called "Cryptocurrency wallets". The sender making the transaction is represented as public key address using the crypto wallet to move money from one account to another. To send funds, a private key address is required, which is affiliated with the account. The transaction between peers is encrypted and then uploaded to the cryptocurrency network and queued up to be added to the public ledger. Transactions are then recorded in the public ledger through a procedure called "mining". Each time a transaction is made, a crypto-currency miner shall be liable to preserve data's authenticity and update it to Blockchain. The mining technique is to compete with other crypto-miners to solve complex mathematical calculations with cryptographic hash functions linked to a transaction data block. The first cryptocurrency miner to break the code would be compensated by approving the transaction. In exchange for the service given, cryptocurrency miners will receive small sums of their Cryptocurrency.</p>
           <p>There are more than a thousand cryptocurrencies on the market, such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and so on, but one of the most influential ones is Bitcoin (BTC). From there, people can exchange cryptocurrencies between computers in a global peer-to-peer network without the needs of central authorities, government looking into your privacy. It's is the future gold assets but in digital form.</p>
           <p>With this rapid growth from Blockchain technology, we could see the future development of this technology not only in the financial industry like Cryptocurrency. But in lots of different ways like preventing voter fraud when it's come to electing the president of a country. Keeping people's vulnerable digital medical records data safe from getting cyber-attacks. Refugee Aids by sending cryptocurrency vouchers to 3rd world countries that suffer from wars and have no access to government support, and so on. Blockchain will make a critical impact in the future of technologies.</p>

For comparison, over one third of the world's countries do not have access to essential financing services that will help them in the event of a personal financial crisis â€“ mortgages, audit services, etc. With the outstanding development of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, now many applications and exchanges allow users to buy, sell and use cryptocurrencies globally without approval from authorities or government control so that trading can be done freely with Blockchain decentralization technology.</p>
           <p>In the last recent years, Big companies worldwide are starting to adopt Blockchain Technology into their operations. Please take a look at companies like Walmart and nine other grocery companies that have teamed up with IBM to develop a Blockchain to track records across their supply chains. And this year, companies like MicroStrategy put 90% of their capital on this bold allocation to buy Cryptocurrency (BTC). Companies like Paypal already allow users to buy, hold, and sell Cryptocurrency. Sooner or later, Blockchain technology and Cryptocurrency will significantly impact people's lives around the globe.</p>

           <p>As of today, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies have no practical impact on our lives. But the truth is, Blockchain has an effect on our daily lives. It is just that technology is in its early stages and is prone to transition and growth. For example, the healthcare networks and the number of data required to be searched and retrieved everyday. It requires a lot of time. With Blockchain's support, we will build a global timestamp record database and a library that enables fast data extraction through various databases. And with the pace of monetary inflation we are currently in right now; Cryptocurrency will be in the lead as an alternative method of inflation protection due to the restriction of total circulation supply on Cryptocurrency. It just like Gold but in digital form.</p>
           <p>Cryptocurrency will become the default currency worldwide for many people, eliminating exchange-rate fees and other costs associated with exchanging money. But this is just the beginning of its journey; in order to gain people's interest, Cryptocurrency needs to be easy for everyone to participate.
