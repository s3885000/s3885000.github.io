          <p>I’m fortunate enough to have friends who those already been working in the IT industry for quite a long time. Paul is one of my close friend’s friends. He has been working in IT since he was 19 years old ... so 38 years of experience in IT fields. Paul learned to program when he was 13 in 1977, which was unusual at the time. He was appointed to become CEO at 29 without applying for the job. Of a 20 person company selling software to NASA and AT&T, Optus and Commonwealth Bank, etc.</p>
          <div class="clear sep__5"></div>
          <div class="text1">Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
          <p>I joke that I have had every job in the industry. I have been a programmer, hardware engineer, technical writer (published in multiple magazines and one book), project manager, enterprise architect, product manager, marketing manager, CEO, Chairman of the Board, and Angel Investor. What I enjoy most are solving everyday problems with software and hardware to improve both productivity and accuracy of any business.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>I have worked in a range of industries including communications and networking, PC manufacture, telecommunications, oil and gas, and medical research. IT spans such a range of industries that the opportunities for interesting work are endless I find.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">What other kinds of work do you have to do?</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>As a programmer I had to design applications, operating systems and firmware, then build and test all of it. As a manager I obviously have had to manage people, hire and fire them, produce budgets and project schedules, create product roadmaps and so on.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>As a programmer I might interact with a project manager, the clients themselves (internal or external), and my colleagues on the team. I might also have to interact with hardware engineers if I am writing low level code such as firmware or operating systems. As an enterprise architect I would have to convey my architectural vision to the project managers and the development teams.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>The best IT professionals are both smart and humble. The field is so large and varied that there is always something new to learn… and being humble allows you to both teach others what you know and learn from them well. I have worked with some who were very smart but almost impossible to deal with owing to their arrogance and attitudes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">What about your interactions with clients or investors?</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>Clients often don’t really know what technology can do for them, or perhaps have a very simplistic view of it. I try to encourage them to really delve deeply into what they do on a day to day basis so that I can envisage all the many ways IT might really improve the operations of the business AND the day to day workflows of the individuals and outcomes for **their** clients.</p>
            <p>Investors are often very savvy business people in their own fields but not necessarily in mine. Mutual respect and an understanding of their motivations for investing can make working with them much easier.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>For technical work I spend a lot of time optimizing the design. Coming up with innovative ways to solve problems more simply so that what is built is more robust and easier to extend or maintain. When running a project or business I spend a lot of time in a similar way, but this time envisaging optimizing the project schedule or the vision for the business and its products.</p>

        <div class="blog">
          <div class="text1">Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</a></div>
          <div class="extra_wrapper">
            <p>FInteracting with people! Clients, colleagues, managers, board members and investors are all human beings. Being really good at communicating, especially **listening** can make interactions with all the many stakeholders much easier. Great listening skills, excellent empathy, and a desire to see everyone have their needs met go a long way to making you successful at any level.</p>

          <div class="blog">
            <div class="text1">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</a></div>
            <div class="extra_wrapper">
              <p>The IT industry is **critical** to virtually every aspect of human endeavor. It’s critical to business obviously, but it’s also critical to science, health care, education, government and so on. When COVID made people think of which groups in the community were “essential workers”, in my view underpinning EVERYBODY else, doctors, nurses, government, business, education etc. were IT people. Without IT people keeping the Internet running and all the other essential IT infrastructure the world relies upon daily, things would have ground to a halt… even and especially healthcare.</p>
