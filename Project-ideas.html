           <p>This project idea is a public transportation card top-up system that allows the user to efficiently perform top-up procedures using technology for over a decade of development. Near-field communication (NFC) is a technology for short-range wireless networking that enables NFC-enabled devices to interact with one another. (Near Field Communication (NFC) Definition, 2020) From this powerful feature, we can develop an application that can run on varieties of modern-day phone operating systems that support NFC feature. Users can check their public transportation card's balance with just a single touch and recharge their balance in a blink of an eye.</p>

           <p>In Australia, almost 3.4 million Sydney residents use public transport, equivalent to 76% of the area's population, and more than 3 million Melburnians (71% of the population) use public transport. A significant drop-off in public transportation use in Brisbane after these two big cities: 1.2 million (59 percent), Perth-1 million (60 percent), and Adelaide- 660,000 (59 percent). Just 100,000 Hobart people use public transit, accounting for just over half (52 percent of the area's population in recent three months. According to these statistics, we can see a massive number of residents around Australia depending on public transportation. From daily commuters to young Australians who need to get to their school on time. With this project idea, Australian residents can save their time from all the hassle to top up their transportation card (Myki, Opal) from the local station machine during busy hours. It can be valuable for people who always active on their feet.</p>

           <p>The purpose of this feature can provide users with an easy task to top up and check the balance on their public transportation card (Opal). By swiping Opal card through the back of your mobile device with NFC-enabled, we can program the device to automatically turn on the application without the process of manually scrolling through your application list. With this application, new features like NFC can be embedded into the application itself. Additional features cans are added to the application for future purposes, e.g., route timetable, an announcement for detour plan when routes are under maintenance, recent travel transactions history, and etcetera.</p>
           <p>With Google Pay, Paypal, and other 3rd party payment application. Passengers can securely perform payment via 3rd party payment processors within a matter of seconds. Other payments such as direct debit can be also added to the application in the future. The existence of physical public transportation cards can be beneficial as passengers don't need to switch to a new one. We can program the application to be able to read the chip card already rooted inside the passenger's card. Therefore, we can cut down the cost to create a newer version of the card and be beneficial for our planet's environment.</p>
           <p>Furthermore, we can take advantage of existing card readers on public transport without building new infrastructure. From this application, we can expand into using NFC feature directly onto the public transportation card reader without physical card needs in the future. By registering a digital card on the application, travelers won't need to find ticket offices or retail agents to get a physical card to start their journeys.</p>

           <p>To prosecute this project becomes a reality; there are quite a few tools and technologies those cans be the backbone of this application. We want to make sure user's privacy information and identity are safe and secure. Here are a few examples of tools and technologies we can consider when coming to building an application.</p>
           <p>Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a framework for low-code innovation that helps you create flexible, stable enterprise applications that can be deployed anywhere with world-class functionality. Developers can quickly build and deploy convincing applications using APEX, which address specific challenges and have instant benefit. SQL is a data sub-language handled by relational database management systems for access to relational databases. SQL will be our second most crucial software for our project. It allows us to develop and create a secure cloud-native database to store the user's private information.</p>
           <p>There is quite a few other software to support this project, but the two mentioned above will be the essential tools.</p>

            <p>When it comes to developing an application, this project's most basic essential skill will be coding. It involves a set of procedures for programming an application designed for fast operating smartphone devices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in order to create a quality application, any developers will know how important is quality User Interface Design when it comes to building a quality-rich user interface. A quality interface helps prevent users from encountering errors or bugs when using the application and the familiar interface's simplicity.</p>
            <div class="IT_technology_content"><img src="images/user_interface_design.jpg">*image was taken from the Internet</div>
            <p>Thirdly, cross-platform application development will come in handy when developing an application. It is crucial to have a wide range of knowledge on multiple operating platforms regarding market needs. IOS, Android, and Windows are the three leading players in the smartphone market right now.</p>

            <p>If this project proposal is successful, not only can Australian residents save their time significantly during peak hours, but they can reduce the usage of cash and possible cashless payments for all in this Industry 4.0 world. Less usage of cash would contribute to lower crime rates. People would feel more safe as they go outside. When it comes to cashless transfers, it may be helpful to society as it decreases the risk of theft and reduces tax avoidance. Besides, with the advent of smart card travel systems, we might reduce a range of costs and income from the production of elements.</p>
